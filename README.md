### Hi there ğŸ‘‹  


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the BlueMicro_BLE firmware as well as keyboard hardware.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning about everything...
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a robust Arduino Library
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: jpconstantineau@gmail
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have run 4 marathons; even though I have failed my last year of high school gym; because I couldn't run.  It's not about being the fastest; it's about being active!
